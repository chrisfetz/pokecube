  Add a Card:
  <%= form_with(model: [ @cube, @cube.cube_cards.build ], local: true) do |form| %>
  <p>
    <%=
      # This will eventually be replaced by a <select><option> each with the
      #   name of the card, the set, and the number with values equal to ID
      #   for easy insertion into cube_cards table.

      # Will also consider adding a coffee script that loads the image asset
      #   for each card upon selection (by Option.value)
      form.number_field :card_id, value: 1
    %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= form.submit %>
  </p>
  <% end %>
